## Problems Encounterred

I encountered some problems while trying to finish this project.

### Tracking the ball 

This is the first problem I encountered. As you can see in the no-hsv branch, my first attempt was just using OpenCV's builting circle detector to dected a ball. The problem with that is that it wasn't very accurate: often times the tracking would go somewhere else.

### Counting the peaks

## What I liked

## Improvements

### Use Deep Learning to find/track the ball

## What I learned

- Python OpenCV
- Manipulating videos all around
- Little SciPy
